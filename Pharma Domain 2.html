                        <p class = "main-text">
                        This is the first phase and includes identifying the lead compound(chemical/biological compound)
                        which fits in the target and cures a particular disease.
                        Drug is a chemical substance that interacts with the proteins in the body to affect physiological functions.                                        </br>
                        <strong>Types of drugs:</strong> </br>
                        Oral (tables, capsules, syrup)</br>
                        Dermatology (cream, ointment)</br>
                        Parenterals (Intravenous, Intramuscular)</br>
                        </p>

                        <h2> Pre-Clinical Trials </h2>

                        This phase includes testing the safety and efficacy on animals. </br>


                                <div class = "container1b">
                                <h2> Clinical trials </h2>

                                Clinical trials in turn include three phases</br>
                                <strong>Phase 1 </br></strong>
                                Conducted on healthy volunteers </br>
                                <strong>Phase 2 </br></strong>
                                Conducted on limited number of patients (hundreds in number)</br>
                                <strong>Phase 3 </br></strong>
                                Conducted on larger number of patients from across the globe. </br>
                                Note that in each of the above phases safety and efficacy are the primary concerns.
                                </p>
                                <h2> Post Marketing Surveillance </h2>
                                <p>This is when the safety of a drug is monitored after being released in the market.</br>
                                <strong>Pharmacovigilance :</strong>
                                Watching the effects of drugs at this point to understand any adverse reactions due to the drug.
                                </p>

                            <h3>Interesting innovations in cancer treatment</h3>
                            <p class="main-text">
                            <strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Makes the patient's immune system stronger enabling it to act on the tumor cells.
                            For the CAR(Chimeric antigen receptor) T cells treatment, immune cells from a patient's bloodstream are taken and are                             reformed in such a way that they can attack a particular protein present in the cancer cells. The immune cells are re-                             injected into the patient's body, where the cells would act on the tumor cells.</br>
                            This method is less toxic and more specific to the patients compared to chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy etc.                               Also, the results have shown remarkable success for B cell malignancies.<br>
                            A world renowned service provider for immunotherapy is creative biolabs. They has a large collection of CAR products                               and they continue to innovate.
