        <h3> Therapeutic areas include  </h3>
        <h3> Drug Discovery </h3>
        This is the first phase and includes identifying the lead compound(chemical/biological compound)
        which fits in the target and cures a particular disease.

        <h3> Pre-Clinical Trials </h3>

        This phase includes testing the safety and efficacy on animals. 

        <h3> Clinical trials </h3>
        <p class="main_text">
        Clinical trials in turn include three phases</br>
        <strong>Phase 1 </br></strong>
        Conducted on healthy volunteers </br>
        <strong>Phase 2 </br></strong>
        Conducted on limited number of patients (hundreds in number)</br>
        <strong>Phase 3 </br></strong>
        Conducted on larger number of patients from across the globe. </br>
        Note that in each of the above phases safety and efficacy are the primary concerns.
